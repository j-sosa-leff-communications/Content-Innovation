      question: "Driving revenue",
      answer:
        "For a long time, many of those involved with thought leadership simply denied it was content marketing, arguing it was designed to showcase knowledge and it was merely a bonus if business resulted from its publication. Those days are gone. No one today denies the fundamental purpose of thought leadership is to drive work, even if it’s difficult to draw a straight line between what’s published and the return on that investment. \n \n “My key metric is client conversations,” said Josselyn Simpson, vice president and global editorial director at Heidrick & Struggles. “That’s actually really powerful because it gives a shape to what we do. And I think for a lot of firms, thought leadership is meant to be the solution to all the intractable problems of our brand, of our conversations, of increasing market share. But we are not trying to be all things to all people.” \n \n So what kind of thought leadership works best for moving users down the marketing funnel from awareness to consideration? It’s complicated, given its myriad formats, channels, and audiences. Clients and potential clients fundamentally look to thought leadership for answers to specific business problems. For organizations with distinct products and solutions, a single article may be all that’s needed to convince someone. Yet for others, the moment they decide they need a company’s help may actually be the culmination of a long process of consuming insightful thought leadership, with the final tipping point nothing more than a social media post hitting the right individual at the right moment."
